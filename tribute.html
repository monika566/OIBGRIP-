        <p id="tribute-info"> Mother Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC (born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, Albanian: 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), honoured in the
           Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, was an Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary. She was born in Skopje (then known as Üsküp, now the capital of North Macedonia), then part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. After living in Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived for most of her life.<br><br>
            Mother Teresa was the founder of the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to helping the poor.
             Considered one of the 20th Century's greatest humanitarians, she was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in 2016.

            <h2>Who Was Mother Teresa?</h2>
            <p>Nun and missionary Mother Teresa, known in the Catholic church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, devoted her life to caring for the sick and poor. 
              Born in Macedonia to parents of Albanian-descent and having taught in India for 17 years, Mother Teresa experienced her "call within a call" in 1946. 
              Her order established a hospice; centers for the blind, aged and disabled; and a leper colony. In 1979 she received the Nobel
               Peace Prize for her humanitarian work. 
              She died in September 1997 and was beatified in October 2003. In December 2015,
               Pope Francis recognized a second miracle attributed to Mother Teresa, clearing the way for her to be canonized on September 4, 2016.</p>

            </p>
            <h2>When and Where Was Mother Teresa Born?</h2>
            <p>Mother Teresa was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, the current capital of the Republic of Macedonia. The following day, she was baptized as Agnes Gonxha
               Bojaxhiu.</p>

            </p>
            <h2>A Compassionate Heart</h2>
            <p>Mother Teresa was not her real name. Her childhood name was Agnes. She was a woman who was born with love and compassion in her heart.
               From childhood, Agnes' heart was filled with immense compassion. She was too pious from an early age and committed to charity. 
               She got such great values from her mother.
                Agnes and her mother helped others as far as possible and also they always prayed for the others.
                 Dranafile regularly helped others by giving them food, clothes, and other essential items.</p>
                <h2>Mother Teresa’s Awards and Recognition</h2>
                <p>In February 1965, Pope Paul VI bestowed the Decree of Praise upon the Missionaries of Charity, which prompted Mother Teresa to begin expanding internationally.
                   By the time of her death in 1997, the Missionaries of Charity numbered more than 4,000 — in addition to thousands more lay volunteers — 
                   with 610 foundations in 123 countries around the world.

                    The Decree of Praise was just the beginning, as Mother Teresa received various honors for her tireless and effective charity. 
                    She was awarded the Jewel of India, the highest honor bestowed on Indian civilians, as well as the now-defunct Soviet Union's Gold Medal 
                    of the Soviet Peace Committee. In 1979, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her work 
                    "in bringing help to suffering humanity."</p>
                 In 1950, Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious 
                 congregation that had over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 countries as of 2012. 
                 The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis.
                  It also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools.
                   Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, and also profess a fourth vow – to give "wholehearted free service 
                   to the poorest of the poor."</p>
